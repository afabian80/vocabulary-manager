for its environment.

152
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,334
to get to 12. But what if you had zero?

153
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:04,207
A non-seeing organism and built
genetically an eye from scratch...

154
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,126
a zero to 12.

be worms that are blind...

542

or even know about light, right?

558

them is unimaginable.

they do. Right?

00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,572

- (PILLS RATTLE)
- In the hospital, Tobias' eyes come up

921
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,389
as a match with Paul Edgar Dairy...

922
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,309
which is not correct because
Tobias has blue eyes...

923
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,019
and Paul Edgar Dairy has brown eyes.

924
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,189
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.

925
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:07,859
It's based on the unique crypts,
furrows and shapes in the texture.

926
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,237
So, maybe Tobias and Paul
have the same iris pattern.

927
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:12,781
Statistically impossible.

928
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,908
KAREN: Second data point...

929
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,584
Tobias and Paul have
some kind of connection.

930
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,704
It's not our test, so we don't know.

931
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,831
And the third data point is that...

932
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:25,752
Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.

933
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,594
Was conceived.

934
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:31,174
Was conceived.
Because Tobias was born in July...

935
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,678
and Paul Edgar Dairy
dies in September 2012.

936

a patent on iris biometrics...

run it and see if it's in the system

954

and check when and where
it was registered.

01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:15,635

- What are you thinking, Karen?
- Well, check this out.

968
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:50,754
So, Paul and Tobias have the same
iris patterns, let's just say.

969
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,213
And there's some sort of connection.

970
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:56,641
So the next logical step in
our scientific inquiry is...

971
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:01,055
to find someone that we do know
who's a duplicate in the system.
